# calculator

##### UNIT TESTING: 
- [x] add() - add 1 to 4 and get 5
- [x] subtract() subtract 4 from 7 and get 3
- [x] multiply() - multiply 3 by 5 and get 15
- [x] divide() - divide 21 by 7 and get 3
- [x] numberClick() - concatenate multiple number button clicks
- [x] operatorClick() - chain multiple operations together
- [x] clearClick() - clear the running total without affecting the calculation

##### UI INTEGRATION TESTING: 

- [x] Do the number buttons update the display of the running total?
- [x] Do the arithmetical operations update the display with the result of the operation?
- [x] Can multiple operations be chained together?
- [x] Is the output as expected for a range of numbers (for example, positive, negative, decimals and very large numbers)?
- [x] What does the code do in exceptional circumstances? Specifically, if you divide by zero, what is the effect? Write a test to describe what you'd prefer to happen, and then 
- [x] correct the code to make that test pass (you will need to modify the Calculator model to meet this requirement).
